## 🔐 Critical Security Fixes

### 1. ✅ PostgreSQL Type Mismatch - Auth.uid() vs TEXT (October 12, 2025)

**Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

#### Problem
After migrating from Supabase Auth to Clerk authentication, database functions were failing with error:
```
operator does not exist: text = uuid
Error Code: 42883
```

#### Root Cause
- Clerk user IDs are TEXT format (e.g., `user_33ZRTFJ4KotDYuXdS3j1T4649vw`)
- PostgreSQL's `auth.uid()` function returns UUID type
- Database functions `get_my_role_from_db()` and `get_user_role()` were using `auth.uid()` to query `user_profiles` table
- This caused type mismatch: comparing UUID with TEXT field

#### Security Impact
- **Broken Access Control:** RLS policies couldn't properly identify users
- **Authentication Bypass Risk:** Functions returned default 'viewer' role for all users
- **Data Exposure:** Potential unauthorized access to restricted records
- **Update Operations Failed:** Users couldn't update their own records

#### Fix Applied
**File:** `/supabase/migrations/20251012_fix_auth_uid_text_comparison.sql`

**Changes:**
1. Updated `get_my_role_from_db()` function to use `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'` instead of `auth.uid()`
2. Updated `get_user_role()` function to use `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'` instead of `auth.uid()`
3. Changed variable types from UUID to TEXT

**Migration SQL:**
```sql
-- Update get_my_role_from_db function to use Clerk JWT
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_my_role_from_db()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
  user_role TEXT;
  user_id_from_jwt TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Extract Clerk user ID from JWT token
  user_id_from_jwt := auth.jwt() ->> 'sub';

  -- If no JWT or no sub claim, return viewer role
  IF user_id_from_jwt IS NULL THEN
    RETURN 'viewer';
  END IF;

  -- Look up role in user_profiles table
  SELECT role INTO user_role
  FROM user_profiles
  WHERE id = user_id_from_jwt;

  RETURN COALESCE(user_role, 'viewer');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Update get_user_role function to use Clerk JWT
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_role()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
  user_role TEXT;
  user_id_from_jwt TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Extract Clerk user ID from JWT token
  user_id_from_jwt := auth.jwt() ->> 'sub';

  -- If no JWT or no sub claim, return NULL
  IF user_id_from_jwt IS NULL THEN
    RETURN NULL;
  END IF;

  -- Look up role in user_profiles table
  SELECT role INTO user_role
  FROM user_profiles
  WHERE id = user_id_from_jwt;

  RETURN user_role;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

#### Verification
- ✅ Record updates now work correctly
- ✅ RLS policies properly enforce role-based access
- ✅ Users can only access their authorized records
- ✅ Admin functions work as expected

#### Files Modified
1. `/supabase/migrations/20251012_fix_auth_uid_text_comparison.sql` - Created
2. `/lib/audit-logger.ts` - Fixed Supabase admin client import
3. `/app/actions/records.ts` - Removed debug logging

#### Migration Applied
- **Date:** October 12, 2025
- **Environment:** Production (Supabase)
- **Applied By:** Claude Code
- **Status:** ✅ Success

### 2. ✅ Clerk JWT Template Misconfiguration (October 3, 2025)

**Severity:** 🟡 **HIGH**
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

#### Problem
Authentication tokens were not being properly passed to Supabase, causing "Not Found" errors when accessing protected resources.

#### Root Cause
Using old JWT template method (`getToken({ template: 'supabase' })`) instead of native Clerk-Supabase integration.

#### Fix
**File:** `lib/supabase/server.ts`
- **Before:** `await getToken({ template: 'supabase' })`
- **After:** `await getToken()` (no template needed with native integration)

#### Security Impact
- Prevented proper authentication
- Could expose unauthenticated access attempts

---

### 3. ✅ Role Authorization Source of Truth (October 3, 2025)

**Severity:** 🟡 **HIGH**
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

#### Problem
User roles were being fetched from Supabase instead of Clerk's authoritative source, leading to potential role mismatch and privilege escalation.

#### Root Cause
`DashboardLayout.tsx` was querying Supabase `user_profiles` table for role instead of using Clerk's public metadata.

#### Fix
**File:** `components/DashboardLayout.tsx`
- Now uses `user.user_metadata.role` (from Clerk public metadata)
- Only fetches `display_name` from Supabase
- Clerk is the single source of truth for roles

#### Security Impact
- **Before:** Potential privilege escalation if Supabase role was modified
- **After:** Roles are immutable and controlled by Clerk admin panel
- Proper segregation of authentication (Clerk) and data (Supabase)

---

### 4. ✅ Default Role Vulnerability (October 3, 2025)

**Severity:** 🟢 **MEDIUM**
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

#### Problem
Default role was set to `'user'` instead of `'viewer'`, potentially granting more permissions than intended.

#### Fix
**File:** `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Before:** `role: (clerkUser.publicMetadata.role as string) || 'user'`
- **After:** `role: (clerkUser.publicMetadata.role as string) || 'viewer'`

#### Security Impact
- Least-privilege principle now enforced
- New users default to lowest permission level

---

### 5. ✅ Redirect Loop Authentication Bypass (October 3, 2025)

**Severity:** 🟡 **HIGH**
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

#### Problem
Incorrect redirect URLs were causing authentication loops that could be exploited to bypass login.

#### Fix
**File:** `components/DashboardLayout.tsx`
- Updated redirect URLs from `/login` to `/sign-in` (2 locations)
- Aligned with Clerk's expected routes

#### Security Impact
- Prevents authentication bypass attempts
- Ensures proper session validation
