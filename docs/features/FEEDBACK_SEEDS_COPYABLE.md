## PLANNED FEATURES (Show commitment to building these)

### 1. Email Notifications for Expiring Trespasses

**Title**: Send Email Alerts When Trespass Records Are Expiring

**Description**:
Automatically notify campus and district administrators via email when trespass records are approaching their expiration date. For example, receive an alert 7 days before a trespass expires so you can decide whether to renew it or let it expire. This prevents students from falling through the cracks and helps administrators stay on top of upcoming deadlines.

**Admin Response**:
We're building this now! You'll be able to customize notification preferences in your settings, including how many days before expiration you want to be notified (3, 7, or 14 days), and whether you want daily digest emails or individual alerts per student.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Email notification system with per-user preferences. Beta testing with select districts in January 2026, full rollout February 2026.

---

### 2. Bulk Select and Update Records

**Title**: Select Multiple Records at Once for Bulk Operations

**Description**:
Add checkboxes to the records table so I can select 10-20 records at once and perform bulk actions like extending expiration dates, changing status from active to inactive, exporting to PDF for court, or even bulk deleting test records. Right now I have to open each record individually which takes forever when managing large numbers of students.

**Admin Response**:
This is one of our most requested features! We're designing a checkbox system with bulk operations including: extend expiration (add 30/60/90 days to all selected), bulk status change, bulk export, and bulk delete (with confirmation). All bulk actions will be logged in your audit trail for compliance.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Bulk selection UI with comprehensive audit logging. Targeting March 2026 release with undo functionality for accidental bulk operations.

---

### 3. Dark Mode Theme

**Title**: Add Dark Mode for Evening and Low-Light Use

**Description**:
Provide a dark theme option that's easier on the eyes when working in the evening or in low-light environments. Many administrators review reports and records after school hours, and a dark mode would reduce eye strain. The setting should save to my account so it stays consistent across all my devices.

**Admin Response**:
Dark mode is coming! We're designing it to work seamlessly with all dashboard components, charts, and reports. You'll be able to choose light mode, dark mode, or automatic (switches based on your computer's time of day settings).

**Roadmap Notes**:
System-wide dark theme with automatic switching based on OS preferences. Planned for February 2026 release.

---

### 4. Quick Search with Keyboard Shortcuts

**Title**: Press Cmd+K to Instantly Search for Any Student

**Description**:
Add a keyboard shortcut (like Cmd+K on Mac or Ctrl+K on Windows) that opens a quick search box from anywhere in the app. I could type a student's name or ID number and instantly jump to their record without having to navigate to the records page first. This would save tons of time for administrators who need to look up students frequently throughout the day.

**Admin Response**:
We love keyboard shortcuts for power users! The quick search will include fuzzy matching (finds results even with typos), shows recent searches, and lets you create a new record right from the search results if the student doesn't exist yet.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Quick search modal with keyboard navigation and recent search history. Low complexity feature, targeting January 2026 release.

---

### 5. Customizable Dashboard Layout

**Title**: Rearrange Dashboard Widgets and Choose What to Show

**Description**:
Let me customize my dashboard by choosing which stats and information cards to display, hiding things I don't use, and rearranging the layout. For example, campus admins might only want to see their own campus stats, while district admins need the full district overview. Being able to save different dashboard layouts for different tasks (like a "reporting view" vs "daily operations view") would be incredibly helpful.

**Admin Response**:
Dashboard personalization is a priority for us! You'll be able to drag-and-drop widgets, resize cards, hide sections you don't need, and save multiple layouts. We're also adding new widgets like "My Campus This Week" and "Students Needing Attention" that you can add to your custom layout.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Drag-and-drop dashboard builder with saved layouts per user. Planned for April 2026 with 8-10 widget options to choose from.

## IN PROGRESS FEATURES (Show active development)

### 6. Advanced Custom Report Templates

**Title**: Create and Save Custom Report Templates

**Description**:
Allow me to build custom report templates that I can save and reuse each month. For example, I need a "Monthly Board Report" that shows all trespass incidents grouped by campus, with specific columns in a specific order, exported to Excel in a format that matches our board's requirements. Right now I have to manually set up filters and columns every single time I run the report.

**Admin Response**:
We're actively developing this! The custom report builder will let you save filter combinations, choose which columns to show, set default date ranges, and even schedule reports to email automatically on the 1st of each month. You'll be able to share templates with other administrators in your district too.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Phase 1 (save templates and filters) releasing January 2026. Phase 2 (scheduled email delivery) releasing March 2026.

---

### 7. Multi-Photo Upload per Record

**Title**: Attach Multiple Photos to a Single Student Record

**Description**:
Right now I can only upload one photo per trespass record, but often we need multiple images - like a front view, side view, and any relevant incident documentation. Being able to upload 3-5 photos per student would give us a more complete record and help with identification when students are encountered on campus.

**Admin Response**:
We're working on this now! The enhanced photo gallery will support up to 10 photos per record, with drag-to-reorder, individual captions for each photo, zoom functionality, and a full-screen lightbox viewer. You'll also be able to download all photos as a ZIP file.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Multi-photo upload and gallery viewer actively in development. Beta testing in January, full release February 2026.

## UNDER REVIEW FEATURES (Show we're evaluating)

### 8. Student Information System Integration

**Title**: Sync Student Data from Skyward or PowerSchool

**Description**:
Integrate with our existing Student Information System (we use Skyward) so when I create a trespass record, the student's demographic information automatically populates from Skyward. This would eliminate duplicate data entry and ensure we're always using accurate, up-to-date student information like current grade level, home campus, and contact information.

**Admin Response**:
SIS integration is our top technical priority! We're starting with Skyward (most requested by our districts), followed by PowerSchool and Infinite Campus. This will require your district IT department to approve API access, but once connected, student data will sync automatically including name, ID, grade, campus, and enrollment status.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Technical evaluation in progress. Skyward API integration targeting Q2 2026. Requires district IT partnership for authentication setup.

---

### 9. Mobile-Friendly Interface Improvements

**Title**: Optimize the Dashboard for Mobile Phones and Tablets

**Description**:
Make the interface work better on mobile devices so I can access records from my phone or iPad while walking around campus. Currently the tables and buttons are too small on mobile screens, and it's hard to navigate. A mobile-optimized view would let me look up students quickly during the school day without having to go back to my office computer.

**Admin Response**:
We're evaluating whether to build native iOS/Android apps or optimize our web interface as a Progressive Web App (PWA). A PWA would work on all devices without needing separate downloads, support offline viewing of recently accessed records, and allow photo capture directly from your phone's camera.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Mobile optimization under technical review. Considering PWA approach for cross-platform support. Decision expected Q1 2026.

---

### 10. Spanish Language Support

**Title**: Translate the Interface to Spanish for Bilingual Staff

**Description**:
Our district has several Spanish-speaking administrators and it would be helpful to offer a Spanish language option. This would translate all buttons, labels, field names, and help text to Spanish, making the system accessible to our entire staff regardless of their primary language.

**Admin Response**:
We recognize the importance of serving bilingual school communities! We're evaluating a full internationalization (i18n) framework that would allow us to support multiple languages over time. Spanish would be our first additional language, followed by others based on district requests. We'd work with professional translators to ensure accuracy of educational terminology.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Internationalization framework evaluation in progress. Spanish translation targeting Q3 2026. Considering community feedback for additional languages.

## DAEP DASHBOARD MODULE (Future module ideas)

### 11. Dedicated DAEP Student Management Dashboard

**Title**: Separate Dashboard for Managing DAEP Placements

**Description**:
Create a dedicated DAEP dashboard module that shows only DAEP students with tools specific to alternative education programs. This would include DAEP placement start/end dates, behavior progress tracking, credits earned toward graduation, attendance monitoring, and re-entry readiness checklists. Right now DAEP students are mixed in with regular trespass records and it's hard to manage them as a distinct program.

**Admin Response**:
A DAEP-specific module is on our 2026 roadmap! This will be a separate dashboard tailored to alternative education needs, including placement workflows, progress monitoring, behavior contracts, academic credit tracking, and re-entry planning tools. DAEP coordinators will have dedicated reports showing program effectiveness, student outcomes, and compliance with state requirements.

**Roadmap Notes**:
DAEP Dashboard Module scoping phase in Q1 2026. Seeking input from DAEP coordinators on must-have features. Development planned for Q2-Q3 2026.

---

### 12. DAEP Behavior Progress Notes

**Title**: Track Daily Behavior Notes for DAEP Students

**Description**:
Add a behavior log where DAEP teachers and administrators can record daily notes about student progress, incidents, positive behaviors, and interventions. This would create a comprehensive record of each student's journey through the DAEP program and help with ARD meetings, parent conferences, and re-entry decisions. Being able to see trends over time (is the student improving?) would be valuable.

**Admin Response**:
Behavior tracking is essential for DAEP programs! We're designing a daily log system where staff can quickly add notes, tag them by category (academic, behavioral, attendance), and see visual trend graphs showing improvement or decline over the placement period. Notes would be included in printable reports for parent conferences and re-entry committees.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Part of DAEP Dashboard Module. Behavior logging with trend analytics and printable summaries. Planned for Q3 2026 release.

---

### 13. DAEP Re-Entry Readiness Checklist

**Title**: Checklist to Track Student Readiness to Return to Home Campus

**Description**:
Provide a configurable checklist that DAEP staff can use to track whether a student has met all requirements to return to their home campus. This might include items like: completed all assigned coursework, attended 90% of days, no major behavioral incidents in last 30 days, parent conference completed, etc. Having a clear checklist helps ensure consistent re-entry decisions and gives students clear goals to work toward.

**Admin Response**:
Re-entry criteria tracking is critical for DAEP accountability! We're planning a customizable checklist feature where districts can define their own requirements (academic, behavioral, attendance, etc.) and track completion for each student. The system will show a progress percentage and automatically flag students who are ready for re-entry committee review.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Part of DAEP Dashboard Module. Customizable re-entry checklist with progress tracking. Districts can define criteria based on local policies. Planned for Q3 2026.

---

### 14. DAEP Parent Conference Scheduling

**Title**: Schedule and Track Parent Conferences for DAEP Students

**Description**:
Add a calendar tool specifically for scheduling required parent conferences during DAEP placements. Many districts require a conference at placement, mid-term check-in, and before re-entry. Being able to schedule these conferences, send automated reminders to parents, and document attendance would help ensure compliance with district policies and keep parents engaged in their student's progress.

**Admin Response**:
Parent engagement is key to DAEP success! We're exploring a conference scheduling system with email/SMS reminders, attendance tracking, and note templates for documenting what was discussed. This would integrate with your DAEP student records so you can see conference history right alongside behavior notes and academic progress.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Part of DAEP Dashboard Module, Phase 2. Conference scheduling with automated reminders. Dependent on SMS/email notification infrastructure. Targeting Q4 2026.

---

### 15. DAEP Program Analytics Dashboard

**Title**: Reports Showing DAEP Program Effectiveness and Outcomes

**Description**:
Provide analytics and reports specifically for DAEP programs, including: successful re-entry rate, average length of placement, recidivism rate (students who return to DAEP), attendance trends, credits earned, and year-over-year comparisons. This data would help DAEP coordinators demonstrate program effectiveness to the school board and identify areas for improvement.

**Admin Response**:
Data-driven program management is essential! The DAEP analytics dashboard will include interactive charts showing success metrics, outcome trends, demographic breakdowns, and benchmark comparisons. You'll be able to export presentation-ready graphs for board meetings and generate compliance reports for state requirements (like PEIMS reporting in Texas).

**Roadmap Notes**:
Part of DAEP Dashboard Module. Advanced analytics with state compliance reporting. Planned for Q4 2026 with initial focus on Texas PEIMS requirements.
