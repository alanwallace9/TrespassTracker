**Category**: TrespassTracker
**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: High

**Title**: Bulk Select and Update Multiple Records at Once

**Description**:
Add the ability to select multiple trespass records at once using checkboxes, then perform bulk actions like updating status, changing expiration dates, or exporting to PDF. This would save significant time when managing large numbers of records that need similar updates.

**Admin Response**:
This is a highly requested feature! We're designing a checkbox selection system with bulk operations including: update status, extend expiration dates, bulk export, and bulk delete (district admins only).

**Status**: Under Review
**Priority**: High

**Title**: Send Automated Email Alerts When Records Are About to Expire

**Description**:
Automatically email district and campus administrators when trespass records are approaching their expiration date (for example, 7 days before expiration). This would help ensure timely renewals and prevent students from falling through the cracks.

**Admin Response**:
We're evaluating the best approach for notification preferences. We want to give you full control over when and how you receive alerts, including email frequency, notification timing, and which record types trigger alerts.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Email notification system with customizable preferences per user. Under technical review for spam prevention and delivery reliability.

**Category**: TrespassTracker
**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: Low

**Title**: Rearrange Dashboard Widgets and Choose What to Display

**Description**:
Let users customize their dashboard by choosing which stats and widgets to show, hiding unnecessary information, and rearranging the layout to match their workflow. For example, campus admins might want to see only their campus stats, while district admins need the full district overview.

**Admin Response**:
Dashboard personalization is coming! You'll be able to drag-and-drop widgets, hide cards you don't use, and save multiple dashboard layouts for different tasks (reporting view, daily operations view, etc.).

**Roadmap Notes**:
Drag-and-drop dashboard builder with saved layouts per user role. Planned for Q2 2026.

**Type**: Feature Request
**Category**: TrespassTracker
**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: High

**Title**: Create Custom Report Templates with Saved Filters

**Description**:
Allow district administrators to build custom report templates that can be saved and reused. For example, create a "Monthly DAEP Review" template that automatically filters for DAEP students expiring in the next 30 days, grouped by campus, with a standard Excel format that matches district board reporting requirements.

**Admin Response**:
We're actively working on this! The custom report builder will include: saved filter presets, custom column selection, scheduling for automated delivery, and export templates that match your existing board reports.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Phase 1 (Custom filters and templates) launching Q1 2026. Phase 2 (Scheduled reports) in Q2 2026.

**Type**: Feature Request
**Category**: TrespassTracker
**Status**: Under Review
**Priority**: Medium

**Title**: Native Mobile Apps for Viewing and Managing Records On-the-Go

**Description**:
Develop mobile apps for iOS and Android that allow campus administrators to view records, take photos, and update information from their phones. This would be especially useful for administrators who need to reference trespass records while on campus or during student encounters.

**Admin Response**:
Mobile access is a top request from our users! We're currently evaluating whether to build native apps or optimize our web interface for mobile browsers. We want to ensure the solution provides offline access and photo capture while maintaining FERPA security standards.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Technical evaluation in progress. Considering progressive web app (PWA) approach for cross-platform compatibility.

## 7. Parent Portal for Notifications
**Type**: Feature Request
**Category**: TrespassTracker
**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: Medium

**Title**: Allow Parents to View Their Student's Trespass Status Online

**Description**:
Create a secure parent portal where guardians can log in to see if their student has an active trespass notice, view expiration dates, and receive notifications when status changes. This increases transparency and helps parents stay informed about their student's standing.

**Admin Response**:
Parent communication is essential for student success! We're designing a secure portal that will show parents only their student's information, with options for SMS and email notifications when trespass status changes.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Requires integration with Skyward/PowerSchool for parent account linking. Planned for Q3 2026 pending partner integrations.

## 8. Student Information System (SIS) Integration
**Type**: Feature Request
**Category**: TrespassTracker
**Status**: Under Review
**Priority**: High

**Title**: Sync Student Data with Skyward, PowerSchool, or Infinite Campus

**Description**:
Automatically pull student demographic information from your existing Student Information System to eliminate duplicate data entry. When a campus admin creates a trespass record, the system should pre-fill student name, ID, grade level, and home campus based on the school ID number.

**Admin Response**:
SIS integration is our #1 technical priority for 2026! We're starting with Skyward (most requested), followed by PowerSchool and Infinite Campus. This will include bi-directional sync for student demographics and attendance data.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Skyward API integration Q2 2026. PowerSchool and Infinite Campus Q3 2026. Requires district IT approval for API access.

## 9. Quick Search with Keyboard Shortcuts
**Type**: Feature Request
**Category**: TrespassTracker
**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: Low

**Title**: Add Keyboard Shortcut to Quickly Search for Records

**Description**:
Implement keyboard shortcuts like Cmd+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows) to open a quick search dialog from anywhere in the app. This would allow power users to instantly search for students by name or ID without navigating to the records page first.

**Admin Response**:
We love keyboard shortcuts for efficiency! The quick search feature will include smart search (finds partial matches), recent searches, and the ability to jump directly to a student's record or create a new one.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Quick search modal with fuzzy matching and keyboard navigation. Low complexity, targeting Q1 2026.

**Type**: Feature Request
**Category**: TrespassTracker
**Status**: Under Review
**Priority**: Medium

**Title**: Translate Interface to Spanish for Bilingual Staff

**Description**:
Provide a Spanish language option for districts with bilingual staff members. This would translate all interface text, buttons, labels, and help documentation to Spanish, making the system more accessible to Spanish-speaking administrators.

**Admin Response**:
We recognize the importance of serving bilingual communities! We're evaluating full internationalization (i18n) support that would allow us to add multiple languages over time. Spanish would be our first additional language.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Internationalization framework setup Q2 2026. Spanish translation Q3 2026. Considering hiring bilingual translator for accuracy.

Add a dedicated analytics page that shows campus administrators charts and graphs of their trespass data over time. Include metrics like: total incidents per month, repeat offenders, average trespass duration, grade level breakdown, and year-over-year comparisons.

**Admin Response**:
Data-driven decision making is key! The analytics dashboard will include interactive charts, exportable graphs for presentations, trend detection, and the ability to compare your campus to district averages (anonymized).

**Roadmap Notes**:
Analytics dashboard with Chart.js visualizations. Phase 1 (basic charts) Q2 2026, Phase 2 (predictive analytics) Q3 2026.

Currently you can only attach one photo to a record. Allow uploading multiple photos (for example, front view, side view, and any relevant documents), with a gallery lightbox viewer that lets you swipe through photos and zoom in for details.

**Admin Response**:
We're actively working on this! The enhanced photo gallery will support up to 10 photos per record, drag-to-reorder, captions for each photo, and a full-screen lightbox with zoom and download options.

**Roadmap Notes**:
Multi-photo upload launching Q1 2026. Gallery UI improvements in progress.
