## ‚è≥ Pending: Critical Testing

### Test 1: Full Invitation Flow
**Status:** üî¥ NOT TESTED

## üöÄ Deployment to Vercel (When Testing Passes)

### Step 1: Prepare Repository
- [ ] Commit all changes to `feature/bolt-mvp-integration` branch
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Create pull request to main (optional, can merge directly)

### Step 2: Configure Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Import repository
3. Configure environment variables:

```bash
# Clerk (use PRODUCTION keys)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

# Supabase (same as local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://gnbxdjiibwjaurybohak.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# App URL (will be your Vercel domain)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### Step 3: Update Clerk for Production
1. Create production Clerk instance (or switch to production mode)
2. Get production keys (`pk_live_...`, `sk_live_...`)
3. Configure paths in Clerk Dashboard:
   - Sign-in URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/sign-in`
   - Sign-up URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/sign-up`
   - After sign-in: `https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard`
4. **Update webhook URL:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/clerk`
5. Add webhook signing secret to Vercel environment variables

### Step 4: Deploy
- [ ] Push to main branch (or deploy preview first)
- [ ] Vercel auto-deploys
- [ ] Test sign-in/sign-up on production URL
- [ ] Test invitation flow on production
- [ ] Monitor Vercel logs for errors
